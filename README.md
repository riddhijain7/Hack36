# Depression Prediction System

## Overview
The Depression Prediction System is a web application developed to predict the likelihood of individuals developing depression based on various data sources and machine learning algorithms. By analyzing user data, including social media activity, demographic information, and behavioral patterns, the system aims to identify early warning signs of depression and provide timely intervention and support.

## Features
- Predictive modeling: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict depression risk.
- User data analysis: Analyzes user data from multiple sources to generate predictions.
- Real-time monitoring: Provides real-time monitoring of depression risk factors.
- Intervention recommendations: Suggests interventions and support resources based on prediction results.
- User-friendly interface: Offers an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for users to interact with the system.

## Installation
To run the Depression Prediction System locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/riddhijain7/Hack36.git
2. In the terminal run following commands: 
    -    cd backend <br>
    -    python -m venv .venv <br>
    -    . .venv/Scripts/activate <br>
    -    pip install -r requirement.txt <br>
    -    python appliction.py <br>
- Backend will be live  

3. Now open frontend folder in terminal and run following commands:
- npm install
- npm start

4. The Website will be live.

## Usage
1. Register/Login: Users can create an account or log in to the system.
2. Input Data: Users provide relevant data, such as social media activity and demographic information.
3. Generate Prediction: The system analyzes the input data and generates a prediction of depression risk.
4. View Results: Users can view the prediction results and recommended interventions.
5. Get Support: Users can access support resources and intervention suggestions provided by the system.

## Technologies Used
- React: Frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Flask: JavaScript runtime for server-side development
- Express.js: Web framework for Node.js backend development
- scikit-learn: Python library for machine learning algorithms
